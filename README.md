## Final Product - Natter

## Project Overview

What is Natter?
Natter is a chat application that encourages users to make new connections. The word originates from Britain and simply means to chat. Chat about what? Well, anything you like. You’re just having a natter. The features implemented in Natter promote positive mental health and our user-friendly and welcoming concept is particularly aimed at those who may suffer from social anxiety or experince social isolation; we want people to feel safe and comfortable making new connections using Natter which is why we chose to implement these features. As it says on our Landing Page: “Good mental health starts with a good natter!" Simply enter your name, click and you’re ready to natter.

## Landing Page:

- Designed with Bootstrap and CSS
- A unique user name must be entered to join the chat
- Natter logo and video of people having a good natter with mental health messages
